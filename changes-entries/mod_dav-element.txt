  *) mod_dav: Some DAV extensions, like CalDAV, specify both document
     elements and property elements that need to be taken into account
     when generating a property. The document element and property element
     are made available in the dav_liveprop_elem structure by calling
     dav_get_liveprop_element(). [Graham Leggett]
