  *) mod_md: the `MDCertificateAuthority` directive can take more than one URL/name of
     an ACME CA. This gives a failover for renewals when several consecutive attempts
     to get a certificate failed.
     A new directive was added: `MDRetryDelay` sets the delay of retries.
     A new directive was added: `MDRetryFailover` sets the number of errored
     attempts before an alternate CA is selected for certificate renewals.
